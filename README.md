# Code Refactor

## Description
This project was provided as a challenge to portray a real-life event where someone would receive an on-the-job ticket and request certain features (in this example, it was making the website accessible) without changing the functionality of the code and adhering to the **Scout Rule**; always leaving the code a little cleaner than when you found it. Ways that made the website accessible: ensuring people with disabilities can access a website with video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. We understood in this project the importance of avoiding litigation and we were provided a small list to help us fulfill the criteria for this project.
